 Market breadth refers to how many stocks are participating in a given move in an index or on a stock exchange.
 An index may be rising yet more than half the stocks in the index are falling because a small number of stocks
 have such large gains that they drag the whole index higher.

Market breadth indicators can reveal this and warn traders that most stocks are not actually performing well,
even though the rising index makes it look like most stocks are doing wellâ€”an index is an average of the stocks in it.
Volume may also be added into these indicator calculations to provide additional insight into how stocks within an index
are acting overall.
